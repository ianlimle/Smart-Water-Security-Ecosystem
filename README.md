# Smart-Water-Security-Ecosystem

## Prototype for Live Fish Count 
A motion detector to test proof the concept of video analytics in optimizing situational awareness of key water installations. The aim is to contribute to a Smart Water Security Management ecosystem with artificial intelligence and automation. It detects transient motion in a location and if said movement is large enough, and recent enough, reports that there is motion. This video analytics module can be interfaced to other devices or systems (ie drones, UAV or autonomous vehicles) where operational requirements demand.
